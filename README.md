**Description: A Java app that sends files and folders to a remote server using SFTP.** 

### What I learned
- I learned how to use MongoDB to save, override, and read data
- I learned how to connect to a remote server with Java
- I learned how to use SFTP to send files and folders to a remote connection

### Requirements
- Java - Most computers and other applications already use Java, but if you do not have Java you can download it from (https://java.com/en/)
- MongoDB - The app uses MongoDB to keep track of every item and the users specific request. If you do not have MongoDB installed you can download the community version from (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- Windows - Windows 10 is recommended, but other versions of Windows will work

### Connect to Server
- Enter the username, hostname, port number, and password for the remote server
- You can save the username, hostname, and port number so you do not have to enter them everytime

### Send File
- Find the location of the file or folder you want to send
- Enter where in the remote server you want to send the file or folder
- Hit the copy button
